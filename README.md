Drowsiness Detection System 🚗💤
This project is an AI-powered real-time drowsiness detection system that monitors a driver's eyes and provides audio alerts if signs of sleepiness are detected. If drowsiness persists beyond a set threshold, an emergency WhatsApp message is sent to a registered contact using Twilio.

🚀 Features
✅ Real-time face & eye tracking using OpenCV & dlib
✅ Drowsiness detection using Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR)
✅ Voice alerts to wake up the driver (via pyttsx3)
✅ Emergency WhatsApp alert if drowsiness continues (via Twilio)

🛠 How It Works
The webcam detects the face and eyes.
The program calculates the Eye Aspect Ratio (EAR).
If EAR drops below the drowsiness threshold (0.14), an audio alert is triggered.
If drowsiness lasts more than 3 seconds, an emergency WhatsApp message is sent.

🤖 Future Enhancements
🔹 Mobile app integration
🔹 Advanced AI-based drowsiness detection
🔹 Cloud-based alert system
